# PCAPa
BASH Script to parse out relevant artifacts from PCAP files.

This project was inspired by a packet threat hunting script from Chris Greer @packetpioneer. Most of the outputs were meant as a
learning project in BASH.

To use any of the versions of PCAPa, place PCAP file(s) in the same folder as the PCAPa-v#.# file, and run via command line,
(i.e. "./PCAPa-0.9"). TShark is required to run this, so a PATH variable is prefered.
